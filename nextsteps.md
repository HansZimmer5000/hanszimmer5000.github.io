Next Steps to get the new Blog Page up & running
- (DONE) Merge the style.css files (./style.css & ../pieces/resources/style.css), Either:
  - Have multiple style.css files, 1 for common content and 1 for each page specifically
  - (Chosen) Have one style.css for all pages
    - Good way could be, to only move the style.css content to the main style.css which was not already in it, aka. move everything thats new.
  - Eiher way, make sure that all pages still look the same after merging
- (DONE) Replace the old blog style with the new one (parts from site.html & ../pieces/pages/blog.html)
- (TODO) Finalize content of the new blog (see left navigation)
  - left side, navigation, will be about grouping similar articles, for now only a "main articles" is fine.
  - what also needs to be done, is to build the articles from `pieces/pages/blog_entries`
