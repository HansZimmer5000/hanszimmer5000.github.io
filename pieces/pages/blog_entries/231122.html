22. Nov 23 - CoPilot

Write a comment what you want to achieve, go to the next line and wait for the suggestion(s). Always good for at least an idea, maybe more.
Would always use it for the tasks when to read or write files.  When I need an idea how to solve something. When I want to try out a new library with basic tasks.
When in flow, I usually already know what needs to be done and do not need input. In that case I only rarely used CoPilot. During that phase there is a risk that CoPilot hinders the flow.
Will miss it. Would like to continue with it. Greatly enjoyed it. It helped us tremendously in a big 18h coding session.

oh nice one. Haben gerade CoPilot Testphase bei uns
Und habe gerade den case, das je nach AZ CLI "command group" anderen parameter einf√ºgen. muss (e.g. az ad group show --group "" / az ad user show --id "")<br>
habe einfach "paramter='--id'" eingegeben und CoPilot hat mir direkt den "test" case vorgeschlagen um es bei einer group zu "--group" zu machen<br>
<br>
<pre>test "$objectIdType" == "group" && parameter="--group"</pre>

Also, suggested
echo "Trying to get user, app or sp with objectId $objectId"

Also correctly suggested  for a function that echos if "debug" is true
test "$debug" == "true" && echo "$@"

However, in an existing JSON it only suggested something when typing in "kv" (for kv name) and suggested correctly, but with false syntax (missing \" to surround key)
kv_name:\"$keyvault_name\",

Suggested nicely based on <pre>policies="$(az keyvault show -n "$keyvault_name" | jq -Mr .properties.accessPolicies)"</pre> and typing "test" in next line
test "$?" != "0" && echo "Error getting accessPolicies for keyvault $keyvault_name" && exit 1
