# GitHub Pages Website

Website was build without all the luxury of JavaScript, PHP, ... this is plain old HTML and CSS. Testing out some "Web Dev" Stuff.

## Build

Execute `./build.sh`, to build the pages into a separate directory, use `./build.sh -t`.
Check the variables set in this script to dynamically change the page that is used as `index.html`.
