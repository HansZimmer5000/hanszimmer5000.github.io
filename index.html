    <br>This site is inspired from various sources to be without any Javascript, PHP or whatever. Just HTML and CSS.

        <h3 class="articlehead">24. Dec 19 - Setup this Website</h3>
        <div class="articletext">
            <p>I always wanted to have an own website, for experimenting with this 'Web Dev' stuff and also for presenting myself to the world. The target of this website was to be as simple as possible, among other sources, I was inspired by <a href=blog.fefe.de>fefe</a>                and his rather simple web blog. I want to go one step further and only use HTML and CSS. This of course limits the visual 'wow'-effect but that's OK.
            </p>
            <p>After I got my domain, I needed a hoster. First I tried DigitalOcean, they are good, but not free. So after a pause on working on this website I moved to GitHub Pages, which is free.
                <br> The hardest part in moving to GitHub was the DNS which was solved after few minutes (everything else took only moments). My registrar had a support site specifically for GitHub where I could find the GitHub Pages nameserver IPs. There
                were not listed in the official tutorial from GitHub.
            </p>
            Right now it seems working smooth for my very low requirements. Let's see how this turns out in the future.
